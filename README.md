# CoinChangeProblem
My resolution to the Coin Change Problem.

## The problem
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

### Example

`Money: 10`

`Coins: [2, 5, 3 , 6]`

`Possible changes: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}`

`Number of Possible changes: 5`
